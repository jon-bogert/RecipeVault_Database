directions:
  - "If adding chicken, prepare Italian cast iron chicken ahead of time and slice into strips. "
  - "In a large Skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallots and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. "
  - Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring frequently, until the paste has coded shallots and garlic and is beginning to darken, 5 minutes.
  - Add vodka to the pot and stir to incorporate, scraping up any brown bits from the bottom of the pot. Turn off heat.
  - Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook pasta until al dante. Reserve roughly 2 cups of pasta water before draining.
  - Return sauce to medium heat and add 1/4 cup of pasta water and heavy cream, stirring to combine. Add half the parmesan and stir until melted. Turn off heat and stir in cooked pasta (along with chicken, if using). Fold and remaining parmesan, and more pasta water (about a tablespoon at a time) if the sauce is looking dry. Season with salt if needed. Serve topped with more parmesan and chopped basil leaves.
